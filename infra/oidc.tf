# Lets GitHub Actions assume an AWS role directly via OIDC — no long-lived
# AWS access keys sitting in GitHub secrets. This is the current recommended
# pattern (GitHub's own docs push this over static keys), and it's a good
# thing to be able to explain in an interview: short-lived, per-run
# credentials instead of a permanent key that leaks once and is a problem
# forever.

# Computed from the live cert instead of hand-typing a thumbprint — a wrong
# hex string here fails validation at apply time; this can't drift.
